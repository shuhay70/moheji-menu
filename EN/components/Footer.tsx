            Founded in 1871 and directly operated by the Toyosu Fish Market, we
            are committed to delivering a unique dining experience through our
            carefully crafted dishes. Each morning, we simmer a homemade broth
            made from a blend of seafood, chicken bones, and aromatic
            vegetables, which serves as the base for our signature monjayaki.
            With our direct access to Toyosu, we handpick premium seafood items,
            grilled fish, and rare delicacies, curating an enticing array of
            ‚Äúsakana‚Äù (small plates) to complement your meal. Each monjayaki is
            freshly prepared by our skilled staff at your table, so you can
            savor the professional quality of each dish at its peak.
